## A2: [Design Inspiration](https://github.com/carriewang1/DECO-7180--Design-Computing-Studio-1---Interactive-Technology/blob/main/A2%20Design%20inspiration.png) 
The first part of this studio involves a rapid exploration and review phase within the scope of the brief. Students will explore background material within the space over 2 weeks and prepare a potential project concept for discussion in class. To stimulate interesting project directions and concepts, you will need to explore the datasets related to the first 5 project briefs and generate interesting ways of focusing, filtering, searching, connecting and/or presenting the data.
I produce a poster that illustrates & explains my idea (or ideas).

## A3 [Rapid Design Sprint and Reflection](https://github.com/carriewang1/DECO-7180--Design-Computing-Studio-1---Interactive-Technology/blob/main/A3_7180_.pdf)
In my the design project team, I have undertaken a rapid design sprint exploring the problem statements and associated datasets. I have developed a proof of concept responding to your selected problem statement that incorporates at least one of the associated datasets.
For the rapid design sprint, I undertake this in the following way:
During my scheduled week, there were four workshops, studio sessions, and outside-of-class time.
The entirety of the week four workshops and studio sessions will be dedicated to working on the rapid design sprint to give you four hours of in-class working time.
