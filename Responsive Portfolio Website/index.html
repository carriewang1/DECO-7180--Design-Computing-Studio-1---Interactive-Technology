                                    <p>Hi, I am Ruobing Wang, well my friends usually call me Carrie.
                                        I was stayed in Sydney for my bachelor's degree, and now I am so excited to move
                                        to
                                        Brisbane to continue my Master's degree in Interaction Design at the University
                                        of Queensland.
                                        I'm a student curious about all novelty things,
                                        especially business data analytics and web/app design.
                                        I love listening to music and painting stick figures in my free time.
                                        My volunteer experience has given me a deeper understanding of teamwork;
                                        this is my first time learning website design.

                                    </p>

                <h3>Before starting this unit,
                    I was always interested in dealing with the parking problem in the city area because sometimes
                    I found it very difficult to find an appreciated parking place near a restaurant.
                    In the context of this,
                    I decide to use Brisbane parking meters and
                    forecasting datasets to make forecasting
                    for parking spaces and also use safety food permits to make sure customers will be able to parking
                    and enjoy their meals. </h3>

                <div>


                    <ul class="list">

                                We grouped randomly, lucky we all interested Inner City Transport.
                                Then, my rapid design topic was similar to our team's thinking.
                                We agreed on how three datasets would join in the following weeks,
                                at the beginning of the design phases. We discussed multiple times in user-centred
                                design parts.
                                There is something like how we help display the map and restaurant and what we can do to
                                make our app more attractive.
                                The rapid design sprint is more like a group of people brainstorming ideas, whereas the
                                more extended design computing project is more about group collaboration.

                <h3> In the future, there are so many things I would change different from this time.
                    At the beginning of this project,
                    I was thinking of making a unique and fun application that could help people find parking lots
                    easily in Great Brisbane.
                    However, there are a few technical limitations for me. Firstly, as a first-year student,
                    I have to do more research to familiarise myself with the contents of this unit, and at the same
                    time,
                    I have to balance my other assessments with this one, which took me lots of time to do so.
                    If there is any chance that I can change this situation,
                    I would like to learn more knowledge on how to get APIs and js before starting this project.

                                The first problem is our first-time meeting this week; we are all first-year students
                                who need to improve at javascript.
                                We need to familiarize ourselves with how to deal with catch APIs to gain some helpful
                                information.
                                Since Our initial idea is for users could booking restaurants with us.
                                In this case, for adding some extra APIs that we plan to add. For example,
                                to finalize our booking function, restaurant photos and information.
                                We have used Google API or Yelp API to get customer reviews and more restaurant details
                                for the booking function.
                                However, all those providers do not permit us to do so.
                                ----Thus, I suggest using our current
                                restaurant information to deal with this problem. For instance,
                                we have safety food scores to show those restaurants' hygiene levels, with restaurant
                                addresses showing how far with nearest parking places are.

                                Moreover, another problem is live time data ( real-time) on detecting car parking
                                available time.
                                However, it also seems impossible to come true because of our lack of technical skills
                                and APIs limitations.
                                ----To deal with this problem, I suggested using forecasting datasets to show car

                                Nevertheless, we faced another problem: we aim to generate a booking function to let
                                users lock this place.
                                Then we have to adjust our project to save them as local storage (user
                                screenshot)instead of the cloud storage of the data.

                                ranking - How to convince the public that 3 or 5 is also a good

                                3. Target audience - How to improve the experience and help families in the early stages
                                of decision-making?----Firstly, We plan to use only the restaurant name to filter our

                                Then, to achieve loyalty to our customers, we decided to keep our entertainment section,

                                along with some research on design flow and features. Next,

                                wait too long before parking.
                                Then I researched three articles: "Optimisation design and evaluation of parking route
                                based on automatic assignment mechanism of parking lot",
                                "Research on smart parking guidance and parking recommendation algorithm",
                                and "An IoT-based parking recommendation system considering distance and parking lot
                                flow. "
                            </h5>
                            <h5>Insights from three articles on adding a Game feature to the web application of our
                                group project.</h5>

                            <h5>
                                A growing number of vehicles on the road has resulted in a general lack of parking
                                availability, which causes additional stress to drivers and increases the risk of road
                                accidents (Hilal, et., 2022). One of the successful functions added to the car parking
                                web is a game used to model driver behaviour in indoor facilities with parking fees.
                                Then The game of life is adjusted to the proposed model by filling, swapping, and
                                emptying cells. Occupied cells with seven or more neighbours are released, and empty
                                cells remain empty. Furthermore, the process of finding available parking increases
                                carbon dioxide emissions. This work explained that a mobile application that uses games
                                to find parking places is easy to find public indoor parking spaces. The mobile
                                application helps the final user to find the recommended parking space quickly. The
                                proposed system achieves substantial improvements for intelligent parking in indoor
                                installations in terms of reducing the time and traversing distance to find an available
                                parking space and can be enhanced with a tool to forecast future demand for parking
                                spaces.

                                Arriving customers maximise their utility by joining the queue, where the utility is a
                                function of the reward for parking and the cost of circling and paying for parking
                                (Ratliff et,.at, 2016). Moreover, it demenstres that social welfare is higher than in
                                standard applications and occupancy and average waiting time are always less than
                                without game addition in innovative car parking applications.

                                As Fang et .at ( 2017) state, the parking guidance system can improve traffic, ease
                                congestion, increase safety, improve the driver's experience, and reduce vehicle
                                emissions. Meanwhile, the parking guidance system can improve traffic, ease congestion,
                                increase safety, improve the driver's experience, and reduce vehicle emissions.</h5>

                            <h5>According to the research from Tsai in 2021, drivers slow down and look for available
                                space when searching for a parking space, but if they cannot find one, they circle,
                                which causes traffic congestion and increases the risk of accidents. Fang's formula of
                                the travel distance between a parking lot and a destination is given by the following
                                terms: reservation credibility, occupancy rate, straight distance, per kilometre of
                                resources consumed, and parking time, which improves the parking space utilisation of
                                the parking lot.</h5>
                            <h5>The layout of AP devices in the parking lot is based on WiFi location technology. WiFi
                                positioning technology can also be used for indoor positioning to predict the parking
                                lot more. A questionnaire about the individual demand of parking users was conducted,
                                and an optimal parking lot assignment model was established(Han et., at, 2017).

                <h3> After the prototype section, I learnt the higher the resolution of a prototype could contribute,
                    the less Feedback. Therefore, in my future prototype, I will keep the more explicit materials
                    possible.
                    As some of the Feedback states, we show so many functions, in the beginning, it makes users
                    feel"dizzy".I will note them down to remind me to implement no more than one or two functions each
                    time as a low-resolution prototype in case of cause overload.As Lerwick et al. discussed, we should
                    inform the users, not explain a prototype; it is a task for us to generate brief goals we expect to
                    achieve. The best material to use is to get from the prototype.

                                keep relevant content.

                                    constant discussions, weekly group meetings and brainstorming sessions, and the
                                    ability to develop solutions as a team.

                                    with expert users. For instance, add main navigation and design other pages such as
                                    contact, about us, how-to-use pages, etc.

                                    This course helped me to develop my problem-solving skills, one of the first
                                    problems I encountered was how to show the calendar on the page and let the user
                                    pick a date. It takes me a long time to search for some resources on HTML, CSS and
                                    js. Firstly, I found an online source, but we had to pay; then, I tried another
                                    research and finally found another option that did not require payment. Secondly,
                                    after the first presentation, some of the audience tell us we should add more photos
                                    of the restaurant. Yelp may be a good option. However, it requires us to send emails
                                    and pay for the resource content. Because of that, we decided not to use restaurant
                                    photos; instead, we chose to provide some phone numbers.

                                    During these twelve weeks of study, I understood a bit about the design industry. In
                                    the previous, I thought that design was art or a sign, not a relastic; however,
                                    after study in this subject, I understand a good designer should understand the real
                                    issue at the first stage so that that designer can make innovations in future. On
                                    the other hand, I also learned how essential users' experiences are, as we did many
                                    user tests, and the users are always the main targets. Thus, in my future design
                                    journey, I will focus more on the potential customers, observing their activities
                                    and attempting to comprehend their queries, motivations and interests.Meanwhile, I
                                    realised we did not prepare very well for the user prototype from the previous user
                                    test feedback. Hence, in the future innovation project, I will improve the future
                                    user prototype processes according to the input.
                                    Last but not least is time management; I feel a little bit rushed during this
                                    period. In the future, I will create my to-do list and balance my other subjects.
